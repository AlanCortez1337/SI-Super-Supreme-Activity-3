PROMPT: Tuffy just got a train cart of random boxes that are sorted based on an id. Help Tuffy find the box he needs to check!

    // ⭐TODO: Ask Tuffy by requesting their input which number they are looking for and store it into a variable

    // ⭐TODO: loop through each element of `mysteryCart` and check if that number exists. If it doesnt then print out "Im crying 😭" but if it is there then print "YIPPIE!!!!"

    // 💡 Pause: In the line below talk between your team and ask what is the efficiency class of the loop you previously implemented
    // ✅ Answer:

    // ⭐TODO: Write code to loop through `mysteryCart` but this time make it significantly faster
    // Hint: think about how we went about our world map finder activity earlier.
