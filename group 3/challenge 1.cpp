/*
PROMPT: Tuffy just got orders that a fruit train is going to swing by the station and needs your help defining it and manipulating the content of it.

// 🥑 TODO: include all of the proper library

int main()
{
    // 🥭 TODO: instantiate a vector of strings called fruitTrain with some random values

    // 🍎 TODO: remove the last element of the vector

    // 🍒 TODO: Clear the vector of all of its elements

    // 🍍 TODO: Create a for loop that loops 3 times

    // 🍇 TODO: Ask the user what fruit they want to add to the cart then push it to the vector.

    // 💡 Pause: In the line below talk between your team and ask what is the efficiency class of the loop you previously implemented
    // ✅ Answer:

    // 🥝 TODO: Instantiate a new vector called copyTrain and copy the contents of fruitTrain into it.

    // 🍋 TODO: push a new fruit into the copyTrain

    // 🍅 TODO: Check if the fruitTrain is empty, if it is NOT then print "Train is loaded and ready for departure! ChooChoo!"

    // 🍐 TODO: Write a while loop that goes through ALL elements of fruitTrain and prints out each item to the terminal

    // 🍉 TODO: Write a range-based loop that goes through ALL elements of copyTrain and prints out each item to the terminal

    // 💡 Pause: In the line below talk between your team and ask what is the efficiency class of the loop you previously implemented
    // ✅ Answer:

    return 0;
